<h1># My Pantry<h1>
<p>A simple app to help you manage your home pantry and shopping list.<p>


<h2>## Description of the idea<h2>

<p>
    Going shopping is a great challenge. 
    First difficult questions: What do we need to buy? 
    What is missing? 
    Do we still have sugar?
</p>
<p> 
    This question gave me great trouble and confusion.
    We have a home pantry with products with a long shelf life.
    I felt I needed an app that would help me with this and be easy to use.
</p>
<p> 
    The main assumptions: 
    The first - there are only full packages in the pantry.
    Second - each product has a defined safe stock.
    Third - fell packaging is moved from the pantry to the kitchen. 
</p>

<p>
    The key functionality is the creation of an automatic shopping list.
    When the quantity of the product falls below the safe stock level,
    a shopping list is generated,
    which can then by printed and taken to the shops

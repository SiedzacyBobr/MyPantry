<h1># My Pantry</h1>.
<p>A simple application to help you manage your home pantry and shopping list.</p>.


<h2>##Description of the idea</h2>.

<p>
    Shopping is quite a challenge. 
    First the hard questions: What do we need to buy? 
    What are we missing? 
    Do we still have sugar?
</p>
<p> 
    This question gave me great trouble and confusion.
    We have a home pantry that has sugar in it but how much - I don't know.
    I felt I needed an app that would generate a shopping list on its own to replenish the pantry.
</p>
<p> 
    Main assumptions: 
    The first - only full packages are included in the pantry.
    Second - each product has a defined safe stock.
    Third - whole packages are transferred from the pantry to the kitchen. 
</p>

<p>
    A key functionality is the creation of an automatic shopping list.
    When the quantity of a product falls below the safe stock level,
    shopping list is generated.
    The shopping list can be printed and taken to the store. Buying what is necessary.
